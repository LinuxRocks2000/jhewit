            </div>
            <p>We celebrate Judaismâ€™s cultural diversity and acknowledge that Jews come from many cultures.</p>

<p>There is no way to look Jewish, rather Jews have a variety of customs and traditions from all over the world.</p>

<p>Our focus is on Iraqi Jews and their heritage namely in Kuwait and Iraq and the Mizrahi culture in general. </p>

<p>We do not privilege one tradition over another rather we connect with the heritage of our lands and seek to accommodate a plurality of traditions in our members to connect with the wider Jewish world.</p>

<p>Kuwait and Iraq have a special place in our hearts given that our initiative was based on them and serving their Jewish communities</p>

<p>However as humanists our vision is worldwide and our concern reflects many cultures both Jewish and non-Jewish.</p>

<p>We seek to promote a safe space where differences are understood and respected. This is a community to celebrate humanity as a whole with a focus on Judaism and preserving Mizrahi culture. </p>
