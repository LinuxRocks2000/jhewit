title: Humanism

Humanism is a focus on action instead of wishful thinking and an occupation with the affairs and general welfare of humankind.

Our Humanism is based on promoting peace and harmony between peoples and nations. It is also service oriented where we seek to be of assistance to the Jewish communities of the MENA region.

We respect all recognized faiths and denominations and tolerate belief or lack thereof. We affirm and appreciate the diversity of humankind across many cultures and traditions as we stand firmly against ethnocentrism and all forms of discrimination.

Furthermore, we value individual liberty including the freedoms of expression, belief, association, movement, trade, and choice along with other liberal values and human rights.

We believe in an inclusive Judaism which affirms humanitarian values and is at peace with the abrahamic/semitic religions and cultures. 

Our focus in Judaism is primarily on secular worldly/humanistic matters namely the concept of Tikkun Olam (fixing the world) along with values such as equality and Social Justice.

Our humanism is apolitical and doesnâ€™t discriminate based on belief, ethnicity, nationality, sex, orientation, race, etc. To us all humans are inherently equal.
