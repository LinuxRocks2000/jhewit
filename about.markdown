The Avraham Society is a Jewish Humanist initiative focused on serving the needs of the Jewish communities of Iraq and Kuwait.

We also seek to promote peace and understanding by raising awareness about Judaism and combatting antisemitism.

We are a community and safe space that is service oriented based on the principle of Tikkun Olam (fixing the world).

Our leadership team is diverse in age, culture, and experiences. We welcome anyone who shares our views and wishes to contribute to our community.
