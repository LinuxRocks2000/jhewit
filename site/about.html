The Avraham Society is the first modern Humanistic and Cultural initiative that is based on and representing the Jewish
Community of Kuwait in all its denominations.

We also seek to promote peace and understanding by raising awareness about Judaism and combatting antisemitism.

We are a community and safe space that is service oriented based on the principle of Tikkun Olam (fixing the world).

Our leadership team is diverse in age, culture, and experiences. We welcome anyone who shares our views and wishes to
contribute to our community.
