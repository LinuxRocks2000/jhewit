We accept all tolerant and open minded people as members of our initiative. Membership is service-oriented therefore we
expect our members to volunteer/contribute to our organization.

We interview our applicants and select them on a case-by-case basis to accommodate their skill-sets and make them feel
included.

Membership fees are open to negotiation and are paid on a monthly basis. We take a holistic approach in supporting our
members that includes the financial, spiritual, emotional, and intellectual.

We do not discriminate and promote the values of peace and equality within our society. Kindly send us an email if you
