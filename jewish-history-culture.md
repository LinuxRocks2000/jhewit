title: Jewish Diversity
---

We celebrate Judaismâ€™s cultural diversity and acknowledge that Jews come from many cultures.

There is no way to look Jewish, rather Jews have a variety of customs and traditions from all over the world.

Our focus is on Kuwaiti Jews and their heritage namely in Kuwait and abroad and the Mizrahi culture in general. 

We do not privilege one tradition over another rather we connect with the heritage of our lands and seek to accommodate a plurality of traditions in our members to connect with the wider Jewish world.

Kuwait has a special place in our hearts given that our initiative was based on it and on serving its Jewish community.

However as humanists our vision is worldwide and our concern reflects many cultures both Jewish and non-Jewish.

We seek to promote a safe space where differences are understood and respected. This is a community to celebrate humanity as a whole with a focus on Judaism and preserving Mizrahi culture.
