# Intro to Judaism

Judaism is an Abrahamic religion of diverse opinions. It encourages learning, has universalist and particularist features, and pursues the perfection of the world and mankind.

Judaism is the collective heritage of the Jewish people and associated with it one can find Jewish culture, history, religion, and languages.

Being an enthno-religion it is also an ethnicity and has a focus on the land of Israel along with the diaspora.

Shabbat (the day of rest), Pesach (which is connected to freedom), Sukkot (festival of booths), and Shavuot (which is connected to receiving the Torah) are important festivals in Judaism along with Yom Kippur (which is connected to repentance)

The Avraham Society seeks to raise awareness about Judaism in all of its unique facets with an emphasis on Judaismâ€™s universalist perspectives and its cultural elements.
