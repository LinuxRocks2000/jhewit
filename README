This is a Sitix (https://github.com/LinuxRocks2000/sitix-rewrite) project. To build it, run `sitix site` in the root directory. The output directory will contain the built site.
DO NOT RUN `sitix build site -o .`! I learned the hard way that recovering the files sitix will delete IS IMPOSSIBLE! And it'll even remove all your git stuff, which I was rather
mad about.
